The case has an anti slippage rubberized feel to it, which gives it a nice secure grip while holding it or while typing on any surface.  The Ipad Air is enclosed in a hard case the snaps closed, completely enclosing the entire Ipad Air. The built in protective screen protector is great and works very well and responsive to the touch screen, its also super clear. After enclosing the case with the TPU material the Ipad Air seems fully protected and all the ports are sealed and covered. I sometimes like to use the case separated in tablet mode but when I&#8217;m typing a lot having the keyboard is very convent. This case has the same features of the airbender 2.0 like when its attached to the keyboard the Ipad air rotates 360 degrees so it can be used in landscape or portrait mode.  Unlike the 2.0 this case has a snap latch to keep the lid shut and stays shut when your transporting it. All port cuts out are large enough that all cables fit and can be used. My initial charge time on the key board only took 2.5hours and lasted all week with mild typing for notes in class. The keyboard paired extremely easy and never lost connection after set up was complete.  I&#8217;m extremely satisfied with this rugged case; function, fit and quality are all there. On a scale of 0-10, 0being the worst case ever and 10being exactly what I was looking for, this case rates easily as a 10. This case will not disappoint.  Thanks for reading my review, if you have any questions please ask and I&#8217;ll try to reply promptly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "NewTrent made a great case even better!", "unixReviewTime": 1406073600, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2014"}
