       " u'Great computer and is more productive with touch screen after getting used to windows 8.1. Has many productivity features that I have not learned the full potential of yet.  Only problem is mouse pad has probably 10 features (not sure yet it does a ton of annoying things) that annoy and take up most the RAM, I am sure there is a way to adjust the mouse settings.  Touch screen is incredibly fast, mouse does its own thing and uses up much of the RAM.\\nSecondly this computer has a great processor just a little on the downside for RAM.  I have purchased a fast SD CARD for additional $20 and Windows Ready Boost has been helping tremendously for Word and Adobe documents.  Most likely going to put 8GB RAM into it so I can utilize the full potential of the computer.',\n",

       " u\"Wifi problems galore. At least 10 calls to hp plus I mailed it in twice. They had me change the router, I did. Still the same problem...They said it was the modem, the cable company was here three times and even replaced the modem.\\nGoogle &#34;HP pavillion wifi problems&#34; and you'll see exactly what I mean.\\nThere is no end to this problem in sight.  Furthermore, I never had my wifi drop ever with my Dell.\\nUpdate 6/22/15...I called hp again and after hearing that they wanted to do a clean install I thought oh boy, I better find my own solution quick. I Googled the dns error while on the phone with support and found a video on you tube, the tech made the suggested changes remotely and after about three weeks of use I haven't had one wifi drop. thus I changes the rating from one to three stars. The tech said he would share this information with other co workers so hopefully at least others will have this problem fixed more quickly. It should never have taken so long but today it works.\",\n",

It's like a huge Swiss army knife with a tool for everything and doesn't leave me feeling like the tool.\\nPros:\\nCan be placed in any position - screen rotation - windows button + O (that's an Oh, not a zero)\\nKeyboard is rather hard and doesn't flex like other laptops I've had\\nFAST - Yes, I said it. FAST! - I use chunky music software on it and it does fine, while downloading linux - hehe - bye windows!\\nTouch screen works well, but like most touch screens, be careful with drag and drop especially in list view\\nTakes a beating - I know; I'm rough on just about everything I own\\nHinges on screen are tough. Maybe a little stiff so I put WD40 on them...JK, don't do that\\nbeats audio - A bit better than I thought it'd be and the app allows you to tweak the sound to your liking\\nLarge solid state drive for bigger applications\\nDoesn't get Hot like many of the other notebook/laptop thingies I've owned\\nCons:\\nPeople might think it's an alternative to a tablet - If that's what you want, buy one of those - This ain't a tablet at 4 lbs\\nComes with bloatwares like McAfee making it take longer to personalize and slows down the machine\\nThe only physical problem with it is the viewing angle of the screen is kinda small and you will not see it's ON if the sun is out\\nI really have beat on it. Even played mechanic under an F250 for a week with it in tablet mode - yeah the screen cleans up.  If there are any cons, why give it 5 stars?  LOOK AT THE PRICE!!\",\n",
